                        <h3>Have A Proper Chat</h3>
                        <p>
                            This is an ongoing project, as it gets updated each month. The first month I updated this was March, when all that needed to be 
                            done was some minor copy changes. In April, some images needed to be changed, and a video needed to be included. In May, a large 
                            change happened - a colour scheme change, as well as copy changes across the 
                            <a href="https://www.giffgaff.com/hub/have-proper-chat/">Have a Proper Chat page</a>, and the 
                            <a href="https://www.giffgaff.com/hub/top-5-tips-keep-having-proper-chat/">Top 5 Tips page</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I created the background gradient using the CSS linear-gradient property. This was the thing I struggled most with, and also the 
                            thing I'm most proud of. I then has to ensure that the images and the emojis were correctly positioned on top of this gradient, 
                            as per the brief. I also added in the top video.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The <a href="https://www.giffgaff.com/hub/top-5-tips-keep-having-proper-chat/">Top 5 Tips page</a> was duplicated from the 
                            <a href="https://www.giffgaff.com/hub/top-5-tips-for-having-a-proper-chat/">original Top 5 Tips page</a>, with some colour theme 
                            and copy changes added.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Copy to Clipboard function</h3>
                        <p>
                            I needed to allow the ability for a developer to copy text, code, or an icon to their clipboard, without them having to highlight 
                            what they needed on the <a href="https://www.giffgaff.design/">design system site</a>. To do this, I added an onclick function 
                            on anything that required copying. As the design system site is built using <a href="https://gohugo.io/" target="_blank">Hugo</a> 
                            templating language, this only required a few places for the onclick to be inserted, and it acts across the entire site. I then 
                            created a placeholder function, which is required for copying to clipboard. I then created a seperate function for each different 
                            thing that needed copying, and targeted those seperately, calling the placeholder function inside each one so as to avoid repeating 
                            code.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I included a span element, which appears when the user hovers over or focuses on the item that can be copied. This allows the 
                            site to be fully accessible, as well as adding functionality. For the SVG icons, I added small icon buttons, which allow the 
                            developer to choose whether they'd like to copy the SVG code or the SVG URL, allowing them to be used in any situation. For the 
                            copying code function, I added a button that can be clicked to allow the developer to copy the entire code block to their 
                            clipboard. Once clicked, this button's text changes from 'Copy' to 'Copied' to give them a reference that the action has been 
                            completed.
                        </p>

                        <h3>FAQ Shortcode</h3>
                        <p>
                            I needed to create a valid <a href="https://gohugo.io/" target="_blank">Hugo</a> shortcode for a Frequently Asked Questions section 
                            for use in the giffgaff design system site, to help other developers keep the giffgaff website looking uniform and on-brand throughout 
                            the site. I also has to include a section in the documentation to explain how this should be used. I had a few difficulties whilst 
                            completing this, the first one being that I needed the developer to be able to add as many list items to their FAQ section as they 
                            needed to.
                        </p>
                        <p>To solve this, I created two shortcodes, the first one is the ul shortcode, which surrounds the list. Inside the ul 
                            shortcode, the developer can then add as many versions of the li shortcode as they'd like, to correspond with how many FAQs they 
                            need to include. The li shortcode then takes the content of the li as a variable, which allows the developer to add thier FAQ text 
                            and even code, for it to display on the website how they would like.
                        </p>

                    <div>
                        <h3>Design Token Imports</h3>
                        <p>
                            The giffgaff design system is set up from the styleguide. On the design system site, it wasn't automatically updating from 
                            the styleguide, which meant that any time the styleguide was changed or added to, the design system site had to be manually updated 
                            to match. This was a waste of time at best, and at worst, it could end up with design styles being used incorrectly, or just missed 
                            altogether.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My challenge was to ensure that this updating was automated, as well as making sure that the code was displayed in the correct 
                            coding language format for each developer depending on how they were using the styles. I set up a language shortcode in Hugo with an 
                            if / else statement, which takes the styleguide directly from the source, and takes the language entered as the shortcode variable. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I then used PrismJS to find the correct formatting for each language, and ran the styleguide through the relevant formatting 
                            before displaying it on the design system site. My only lingering issue from this is that LESS doesn't display with the correct 
                            colour highlighting, which appears to be a small issue with PrismJS. I ran this through as CSS instead to get an easily readable 
                            format.
                        </p>

                        <h3>A11y Accessibility Testing</h3>
                        <p>
                            This uses the <a href="https://www.a11yproject.com/">A11y Project</a> software to check a website for Accessibility best practices, 
                            helping to make digitial accessibility easier for the developer. Originally this was set up to allow only a few URLs to be tested, 
                            with the developer having to enter each URL they want to test within the package.json file. My update now means that if the 
                            developer knows that they work on a set of URLs (for instance, if the developer works within the Phones team, they would want to test 
                            all of the web pages that they work on in the team), they can add all of those URLs into a config file, which A11y will then run 
                            through and test each of those URLs. This config file can then be kept for every time they want to test for accessibility.
                        </p>

                    <div>
                        <h3>CSS Single File Processing</h3>
                        <p>
                            When a developer has created or edited a page, the SCSS needs to be built into the CSS files for the final webpage. When a 
                            developer is only working on one page, it took a long time to build every single SCSS file into CSS, when the only one that 
                            needs building is the SCSS file that has been edited.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I added functionality to this code to enable the developer to specify which file they need to be built, instead of building every 
                            file every time. This increases developer productivity, and reduces the weight on the network, also reducing the carbon footprint 
                            slightly for each page edit.
                        </p>

                    <div>
                        <h3>SIM order and success page analysis</h3>
                        <p>
                            This was my first project from within the BI & Ops team. I was asked to take a look at the three free SIM order pages, and look at 
                            whether those pages were underperforming in any way, presenting a hypothesis and a potential solution.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I started on Google Analytics, looking at the user journeys to and from each page, and the devices they were accessing these 
                            page from. I noticed a strange trend in which many users were exiting immediately from the 'Order a SIM' pages. This was concerning 
                            as we don't want people leaving the website before ordering a SIM. Looking further into this, I found that users on the 'Success 
                            page' after ordering a SIM card were returning back to the 'Order a SIM' page. Why would a user return to Order a SIM when they've 
                            already ordered one? This led me to believe that users weren't being given the continuation options that they wanted after ordering 
                            a SIM card.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I found that the navigation bar was removed on the Order a SIM and Success pages, to streamline the user into the SIM ordering 
                            process. However, this left them with a lack of future links.
                        <ul>
                            I had two hypotheses:
                            <li>
                                The users were returning to the 'Order a SIM' page to view the FAQs, which were visible on the 'Order a SIM' page, but not on 
                                the 'Success page'. This could be fixed by linking the FAQs on the 'Success page'.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The users were pressing the 'Back' button on their browsers, because they didn't want to follow any of the three options that 
                                the 'Success page' gives them.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I created 3 variants in Optimize, the first variant with the FAQs also listed on the 'Success page', the second variant adding a 
                            button to link to the FAQs on a seperate page, and a third variant with a link to the giffgaff community Hub. I presented these 
                            hypotheses and possible solutions to the team, which I then built as an A/B test in Optimize. It is currently waiting to go live.
                        </p>
