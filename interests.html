            <ul><i class="fa fa-music" aria-hidden="true"></i> Music
                <li>I am a keen musician, having played various instruments from the age of 12, ranging from brass instruments to guitar to keyboard.</li>
                <li>I currently play trombone in a ska band (Lead Shot Hazard), regularly performing gigs on the weekends. We've released a 3-track EP titled 'War and Pieces', 
                    and an album titled 'Fires To Find Our Friends'.<br>If you want to see a bit of what we do 
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqXnrUKb3v4" target="_blank">click here to see our music video</a>.</li>
                <li>I have been a member of various brass bands since 2005, including Cinderford Brass Band and Yiewsley and West Drayton Brass Band.<br>
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hA4sTR8T7oQ" target="_blank">Click here for a clip of a solo that I performed</a> with Cinderford Training Brass Band.</li>
                <li>I also ran and conducted the Yiewsley and West Drayton Training Band for the young (and young at heart), teaching them how to play and how to perform as a group.</li>

            <ul><i class="fa fa-heart" aria-hidden="true"></i> Girl Guiding
                <li>I have been a member of Girlguiding UK since 2000, as a Brownie, Guide, Young leader, Occasional helper, and Unit leader.</li>
                <li>I helped start a new Young Leader unit for ages 14 to 25 in 2007, and I participated in and helped run several large scale events in Gloucestershire.</li>
                <li>As an adult, I have recently opened up a Guide unit in my area, as a unit leader. We're currently looking forward to our first pack holiday (camping)!</li>
                <li>I love the fact that Girlguiding teaches about empowerment, giving girls and young women a safe space to learn, grow, and try new things.</li>

                <li>I love being eco-friendly, ensuring I'm recycling as much as possible.</li>
                <li>At my previous jobs, I've been the person to implement recycling measures for the business, even making money for the pub through recycling when I worked at Wetherspoons.</li>
                <li>In my spare time, I look up the latest green technology and advances. My favourite at the moment is <a href="https://pavegen.com/" target="_blank">Pavegen</a>, who create pavement that generates kinetic energy!</li>
                <li>I'm looking forward to getting my first electric car.</li>

                <li>I enjoy seeing how different languages link together, and discovering the challenges that a new language causes.</li>
                <li>The satisfaction from fixing a particularly persistent bug makes it worth the time spent figuring it out.</li>
