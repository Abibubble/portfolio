						This is a cocktail recipe site, made for bartenders, by bartenders.
						It's built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Flask, Jinja,
						MaterializeCSS and MongoDB.
					</p>
					<p>
						I chose to use MaterializeCSS framework for this project, as I
						hadn't used Materialize before and wanted to experiment with its
						use.
					</p>
					<p>
						This was my first full-stack project, and it was really exciting
						getting to see users registering to the site and adding their own
						cocktails.
					</p>
					<p>
						I used the Jinja templating language for this project so as to
						easily populate the data onto my site. I've had some experience
						using Hugo in the past, and this was very alike, so I enjoyed it.

				<div>
					<p>
						This is an informative history site, themed around LGBTQ+ Pride.
						It was created by my team in the Code Institute June 2021
						Hackathon, with the theme of 'Proud Coders' from 16th to 21st
						June.
					</p>
					<p>
						We put a particular focus on styling, using the following:
						<ul>
							<li>
								We used Bootstrap to enable us to create the base styling
								quickly and easily, as we were very limited on time.
							</li>
							<li>
								We chose not to use jQuery due to associated security issues
								and slow load times.
							</li>
							<li>
								We ensured that all images were sized correctly for the
								largest image size, then scaled down properly with responsive
								design.
							</li>
							<li>
								We created a basic JavaScript function to show or hide the
								information as the user wishes.
							</li>
						</ul>

				<div>
						<p>
							This is a simple randomiser built on the theme of a Sorting Hat.
						</p>
						<p>
							It is built with HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript, as it's a very
							basic project, make for my Girl Guide unit for a Harry
							Potter-themed sleepover.
						</p>
						<p>
							I intend to add further functionality in the form of questions to
							decide which house the user is in, in the future.

						This is an interactive drinking game site, themed around St.
						Patrick's Day. It was created by my team in the Code Institute
						March 2021 Hackathon, with the theme of 'Hacking St. Patrick's
						Day' from 3rd to 8th March.
					</p>
					<p>
						We put a particular focus on styling and interactivity, using the
						following:
						<ul>
							<li>
								We used Bootstrap to enable us to create the base styling
								quickly and easily, as we were very limited on time.
							</li>
							<li>
								We chose not to use jQuery due to associated security issues
								and slow load times.
							</li>
							<li>
								We ensured that all images were sized correctly for the
								largest image size, then scaled down properly with responsive
								design.
							</li>
							<li>
								We created a flip animation for the cards, using a mix of CSS
								and JavaScript.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>
						This was my first experience of coding as part of a team, and it
						was an incredibly rewarding experience.

				</div>
				<div>
					<p>
						This is an interactive Harry Potter themed quiz, built using HTML,
						CSS and JavaScript.
					</p>
					<p>
						I chose not to use any libraries or frameworks for this project
						for several reasons:
						<ul>
							<li>
								To showcase my coding and debugging skills, which I feel I
								didn't do as well as I could in the Esape Pool Bar website,
								due to using Bootstrap.
							</li>
							<li>
								Due to the performance trade-offs often caused by libraries
								and frameworks.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>
						This was my first project built using JavaScript, and I really
						enjoyed the freedom and flexibility that JavaScript gave me.
					</p>

				<div>
					<p>
						This is a website for a local pool bar, using just HTML, CSS and
						Bootstrap.
					</p>
					<p>
						This was built to showcase my skills at frontend basic UI / UX
						design, and working to a deadline.
					</p>
					<p>
						This was the first full project I built whilst learning to code,
						and I learnt a lot about responsive design with this project.
